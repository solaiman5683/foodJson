      "h1": "Studies have shown that sleep deprivation hits the body and mind a lot like alcohol.",
      "p1":"That isn’t great, but where do our eyes fit into the equation? When we get enough sleep, it’s great for both our overall health and our eye health, and we can also improve our quality of sleep by changing what we put in front of our eyes before we go to bed.",
      "h2":"What Lack of Sleep Does to Eye Health",
      "p2":"You’re probably familiar with the short-term symptoms of sleep deprivation, such as grumpiness, drowsiness, and difficulty concentrating. Over time, lack of sleep can make our immune systems weaker, make it more difficult to lose weight, increase our blood pressure, and contribute to mood changes and memory loss. It also affects our eyes.  Our eyes need at least five hours of sleep to replenish themselves so that they can function effectively throughout the day. This goes beyond being able to keep our eyes open. Over time, the less sleep we get, the more likely we are to experience eye strain, dry eye, and even eye twitches. The good news is that our eyes play a role in getting more and better sleep that will help them!",
      "h3":"Our Internal Clocks and Blue Light From Screens",
      "p3":"No matter how tech-savvy we are, we can’t change the biology of our eyes. Across all of human history, it’s only been in recent decades that blue light came from anywhere besides the sun. Blue light signals our brains that it’s daytime and we should be awake. When we look at our screens late into the evening, we effectively trick our brains into thinking it’s not bedtime yet."

      "h1":"44% of all eye injuries happen in the home.",
      "p1":"The good news is that up to 90% of eye injuries are preventable if we take simple precautionary measures like wearing protective gear when working with chemicals or power tools and minimizing the unnecessary hazards around the home.",
      "h2":"Identifying the Home’s Main Eye Safety Risks",
      "p2":"An accident can transform the most innocent of objects can turn into a serious eye hazard — everything from the corners of furniture to pens and pencils. Something as simple as getting too close to a skillet with hot oil can put our eyes in danger. However, the most hazardous household items for the unwary eye are toys with small pieces and cleaning chemicals.",
      "h3":"Be Ready With a First Aid and Emergency Plan",
      "p3":"Another component to minimizing the risk of injury is planning ahead so that you’re ready if an accident or emergency happens. The most common eye injury type is when a foreign object or substance gets in the eye or when a foreign body penetrates the eye. For the latter, seek immediate medical attention and don’t try to touch the eye or remove the object. Use a rigid shield (such as a paper cup taped in place) to protect it on the way to the emergency room."

      "h1":"Back in the old days, makeup was full of ingredients like lead, arsenic, and mercury.",
      "p1":"Thankfully we don’t have to worry whether or not we’re putting actual poison on our faces when we apply modern makeup, but we should still take a few precautions to protect our eyes from unnecessary injury and infection. There’s no reason the saying “beauty is pain” has to be true, especially when it comes to eye makeup!",
      "h2":"Put a Little Distance Between the Makeup and Your Eye",
      "p2":"We’re not here to tell our makeup-enthusiast patients to give up their eye makeup, but we do have serious concerns about types of eye makeup that gets too close to the actual eyeball for comfort, including false eyelashes, eyelash extensions, waterline eyeliner, and colored or costume contact lenses. These products can irritate the eyes on their own, and they can also provide a place for bacteria to build up and get into the eyes. Mascara is another type of eye makeup that can be a vehicle for germs. All it takes is one use for the wand to become contaminated. Aside from the infection risk, sometimes even the steadiest hand can slip and we end up poking ourselves in the eye, potentially scratching the cornea.",
      "h3":"Come to Us With Your Eye Makeup Questions",
      "p3":"If you want to learn more about which makeup products are safer or if you’re interested in recommendations for costume contact lenses or regular color contacts, don’t hesitate to get in touch with us. We want to educate our patients as much as possible so that they can continue looking their best while making their eye health a priority!"

      "h1":"Your dentist has probably told you to get a cleaning and exam every six months, but how often should we get eye exams?",
      "p1":"Preventative care is as important for eye health as for dental health, even when you don’t need a new glasses or contact lens prescription. Our eyes are incredibly complex and there are many ways for something to go wrong with them. By getting regular eye appointments, we ensure that any problems are caught early, which is the best time to catch them.",
      "h2":"What is a “Regular” Eye Exam for You?",
      "p2":"Your ideal eye exam schedule depends on your age and your risk factors. We recommend that children get their first eye exam around six months of age, then come back again around their third birthday, and again before starting first grade. These eye exams in early childhood are important for catching, diagnosing, and treating the kinds of vision problems that can greatly interfere with learning but are often overlooked (including by the school nurse). For most people older than that, an eye exam once every two years until age 60 is great. Beyond age 60, we’d like to see you every year. Some cases are different, however, and more frequent appointments are necessary.",
      "h3":"What Are the Risk Factors for Eye Disease?",
      "p3":"One risk factor is a family history of an eye disease like glaucoma or macular degenration, or even a family history of diabetes or hypertension. Others include prescription medications that cause dry eye as a side effect. Keep track of side effects like this to make sure they don’t develop into eye infections or major discomfort."

      "h1":"Among the many changes our bodies undergo as we get older are the changes to our eyesight.",
      "p1":"Early diagnosis is critical for stopping many sight-threatening conditions in their tracks, which is why we should be on the watch for signs of age-related vision loss. There are also more benign ways our eyesight can change over the years, and it’s important to know about those too!",
      "h2":"More Serious Sight-Threatening Eye Conditions",
      "p2":"More Serious Sight-Threatening Eye Conditions 1.Diabetic retinopathy 2.Macular degeneration 3.Cataracts 4.Glaucoma 5.Retinal detachment",
      "h3":"How to Help Your Eyes Stay Healthy",
      "p3":"In addition to the regular eye exams, there’s a lot an individual can do to look after their eye health. No matter what season it is, wear UV-blocking sunglasses outside. Maintain an active lifestyle, which means regular exercise, a diet full of healthy foods, and avoiding harmful habits like smoking. Doing this will greatly reduce eye disease risk factors, and you’ll also get all the other benefits that come with a healthy lifestyle!"

      "h1":"An estimated 90% of eye injuries are preventable if the right eye protection is worn.",
      "p1":"That means that 27,000 out of 30,000 sports-related eye injuries in America could be avoided by taking this one simple precaution. You might think of eye protection as something for welders or construction workers, but clearly, it’s just as important for athletes.",
      "h2":"The Most Dangerous Sports for Eye Health",
      "p2":"Eyewear should be part of your protective gear no matter what sport you play, but not all sports are equally hazardous to the eye. The most dangerous are shooting sports like airsoft and paintball. Next up are racket sports and soccer, and then it’s sports like archery, swimming, lacrosse, hockey, football, and snow sports like skiing and snowboarding.",
      "h3":"How to Choose the Best Eye Protection",
      "p3":"For most contact sports, especially popular ones, it’s not too difficult to find specialized goggles or face masks. If none exists for the sport you play, polycarbonate goggles are a great all-purpose option. They can fit over glasses, are stronger than ordinary plastic, and are shatter-resistant. Sometimes you can even get prescription goggles so that you can leave your glasses safely in your locker during practices and games."

      "h1":"Digital screens have become an increasingly prominent part of our lives in recent decades.",
      "p1":"Whether you work from home on your computer, work from an office on your computer, or simply own a smartphone, you are likely spending a significant portion of your day with your eyes fixed on a bright screen, and this can result in the discomforts of digital eye strain. All it takes is two hours of screen time per day to have a 90% risk of developing digital eye strain, so there’s no wonder over ten million people go to eye doctors about it every year.",
      "h2":"Arrange Your Workspace With an Eye for Comfort",
      "p2":"The angle of your computer screen to your eyes can make a big difference. For maximum eye comfort, position it at least 20 inches from your eyes (if possible), slightly below eye level, angled upward. Place any reference materials you use somewhere that you won’t need to turn your head constantly to look at them.",
      "h3":"Other Light Sources Can Contribute to the Problem",
      "p3":"The screen on its own might not be giving you as much trouble as a combination of the screen, the overhead lighting, and glare from the windows. Try to eliminate sources of glare while maintaining the comfortable screen/eye distance and angle. If you can’t move your workspace around that much, a glare filter for your screen could be a good alternative."
